### Digital Earth Australia for Geospatial Analysts (Course Materials)

### Context

Remote sensing provides us with valuable information about the state and evolution of our environment. Processes such as soil and coastal erosion, crop growth, water quality or bushfires can be monitored through the images collected by satellites. However, these collections of satellite images are often extremely large, which presents a significant challenge to users wanting to process or store these data. 

Geoscience Australia has developed a platform called [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://www.ga.gov.au/dea), that enables users to perform large scale satellite image analysis easily on personal computers.  Using a high-performance storage and computing platform provided by the National Computational Infrastructure, DEA provides the tools to search and analyse high quality satellite image collections that span more than 30 years covering the whole Australian continent.

### Goals

This course presents the tools and techniques for processing satellite imagery through practical examples.

The materials will get you familiar with using the DEA by connecting to the National Computational Infrastructure. A quick introduction to scientific Python is provided and geospatial concepts are presented using practical and interactive examples using Jupyter notebooks. By the end of the course, you will have the necessary knowledge to use satellite data and apply it to solve a wide range of analytical problems using Python.

This training focuses on understanding and using:

- Python and Jupyter for spatial data (Introduction to scientific Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and Xarray libraries)
- DEA (examples of querying, loading, processing and exporting data)
- Geospatial analysis using DEA (examples of querying, loading, processing and exporting data)
