    "## About Landsat \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.\" [[1](#References)] \n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the mid-1960s an ambitious effort to develop and launch the first civilian Earth observation satellite was started. The goal was achieved on July 23, 1972, with the launch of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1), which was later renamed Landsat 1. The launches of Landsat 2, Landsat 3, and Landsat 4 followed in 1975, 1978, and 1982, respectively. When Landsat 5 was launched in 1984, no one could have predicted that the satellite would continue to deliver high quality, global data of Earth's land surfaces for 28 years and 10 months until its retirement in June, 2013. Landsat 6, however, failed to achieve orbit in 1993. Landsat 7 was successfully launched in 1999 and, along with Landsat 8 launched in 2013, continues to provide daily global data. Landsat 9 is planned to be launched in late 2020.\" [[2](#References)]\n",

    "GA has acquired Landsat imagery over Australia since 1979, including TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery. While this data has been used extensively for numerous land and coastal mapping studies, its utility for accurate monitoring of environmental resources has been limited by the processing methods that have been traditionally used to correct for inherent geometric and radiometric distortions in EO imagery. To improve access to Australia's archive of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data, GA has collaboratively developed an integrated approach to image data correction that incorporates normalising models to account for atmospheric effects, BRDF and topographic shading.\n",

    "\n",
    "The NBAR and NBAR-T surface reflectance product suite provides standardised optical surface reflectance datasets using robust physical models to correct for variations in image radiance values due to atmospheric properties, and sun and sensor geometry. The resulting stack of surface reflectance grids are consistent over space and time which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change. Surface reflectance is based on radiance data from the Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS sensors. [[9](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "**NBAR** \n",
    "\n",
    "NBAR stands for Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance, where BRDF stands for Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function. The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute surface-leaving radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standardised NBAR product delivers calibrated optical surface reflectance data across land and coastal fringes. NBAR is a medium resolution (~25 m) grid based on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI archive and presents surface reflectance data in **25 square metre grid cells** in the **Australian Albers Equal Area (EPSG:3577)** projection system.\n",
    "* Radiance measurements from Earth Observation (EO) sensors do not directly quantify the surface reflectance of the Earth. Such measurements are modified by variations in atmospheric properties, sun position, sensor view angle, surface slope and surface aspect. To obtain consistent and comparable measures of Earth surface reflectance from EO, these variations need to be reduced or removed from the radiance measurements. This is especially important when comparing imagery acquired in different seasons and geographic regions.\n",
    "* NBAR surface reflectance is created using a physics-based, coupled BRDF and atmospheric correction model that can be applied to both flat and inclined surfaces. The resulting surface reflectance values are comparable both within individual images and between images acquired at different times and/or with different sensors. [[9](#References)]\n",

    "* Terrain affects optical satellite images through both irradiance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects.\n",
    "Slopes facing the sun receive enhanced solar irradiance and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun.\n",
    "* For anisotropic surfaces, the radiance received at the satellite sensor from a sloping surface is also affected by surface BRDF which varies with combinations of surface landcover types, sun, and satellite geometry (sun and sensor view, and their relative azimuth angle) as well as topographic geometry (primarily slope and aspect angles). Consequently, to obtain comparable surface reflectance from satellite images covering mountainous areas, it is necessary to process the images to reduce or remove the topographic effect so that the images can be used for different purposes on the same spectral base.\n",
    "* A Digital Surface Model (DSM) resolution appropriate to the scale of the resolution of satellite image is needed for the best results. 1 second SRTM DSM is used for NBAR-T processing. [[9](#References)]\n",

    "\n",
    "\"The Scan Line Corrector (SLC) is an electro-optical mechanism composed of two parallel mirrors set at an angle on a shaft. The SLC is positioned behind the primary optics and compensates for the along-track motion of the spacecraft occurring during an active SMA cross-track scan. As a result, a rectilinear scan pattern is produced using the SLC instead of the zigzag pattern that would be produced without it. The SLC failed for Landsat 7 on May 31, 2003. Without an operating SLC, the ETM+ line of sight now traces a zig-zag pattern along the satellite ground track (see the figure above) resulting in wedge shaped scan-to-scan gaps (and alternating overlap areas) which increase in magnitude away from nadir. Despite the SLC failure, Landsat 7 ETM+ is still capable of acquiring useful image data with the SLC turned off (SLC-off), particularly within the central portion of any given scene.\" [[8](#References)]\n",

This striping will be present in all post-May 31 2003 `ls7_nbar_albers` and `ls7_nbart_albers` data in the DEA archive.
