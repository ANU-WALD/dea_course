    "#### Digital Earth Australia produces Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for each of the sensors listed above. The [ARD standard](http://ceos.org/ard/) for satellite data requires that data have undergone a number of processing steps, along with the creation of additional attributes for the data. DEA's ARD datasets include the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geometric correction:** This includes establishing ground position, accounting for terrain (orthorectification) and ground control points, and assessing absolute position accuracy. \n",
    "Geometric calibration means that imagery is positioned accurately on the Earth's surface and stacked consistently so that sequential observations can be used to track meaningful change over time.\n",
    "Adjustments for ground variability typically use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).\n",
    "* **Surface reflectance correction:** This includes adjustments for sensor/instrument gains, biases and offsets, include adjustments for terrain illumination and sensor viewing angle with respect to the pixel position on the surface.\n",
    "Once satellite data is processed to surface reflectance, pixel values from the same sensor can be compared consistently both spatially and over time.\n",
    "* **Observation attributes:** Per-pixel metadata such as quality flags and content attribution that enable users to make informed decisions about the suitability of the products for their use. For example, clouds, cloud shadows, missing data, saturation and water are common pixel level attributes.\n",

    "#### Optical sensors mounted on satellites measure the energy that comes from the sun and has been reflected by the Earth's surface. The sensor measures the energy in each of its spectral bands. There are many factors that affect the amount of energy that reaches the satellite sensor such as the solar and satellite angles relative to the surface and the atmospheric conditions. In order to analyse and compare images taken at different times, the data needs to be normalised into some standard conditions. Surface reflectance is one of this normalisations and is calculated using advanced physical models to correct the reflectance values taking into account atmospheric conditions, sun and satellite angles and local topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DEA offers to options for adjusted or normalised surface reflectance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NBAR**: NBAR stands for *Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance*, where BRDF stands for *Bidirectional reflectance distribution function*. The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute bottom-of-atmosphere radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance. NBAR can be useful for analyses in extremely flat areas not affected by terrain shadow, and for producing attractive data visualisations that are not affected by NBART's nodata gaps (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NBART**: NBART has the same features of NBAR but includes an additional *terrain illumination* reflectance correction that takes into account the surface topography. Terrain affects optical satellite images in a number of ways; for example, slopes facing the sun receive more sunlight and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun. This correction is performed with a Digital Surface Model (DSM). NBART is typically the default choice for performing analysis that are consistent through time. However, it can be introduce distortion in flat areas due to the noise in DSM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison between NBAR and NBART](data/nbar_nbart_animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The animation above demonstrates how the NBART correction results in a significantly more two-dimensional looking image that is less affected by terrain illumination and shadow. Black pixels in the NBART image represent areas of deep terrain shadow that can't be corrected as they're determined not to be viewable by either the sun or the satellite. These are represented by -999 `nodata` values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Remember that remote sensing data is often stored as `uint16` to save space and `NaN` is only available for floating point types, that is why we need a value `-999` in this case to designate not-a-number data."

    "#### The *Observation Attributes (OA)* are a suite of measurements included in DEA's analysis ready datasets. They are an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation of the Earth's surface, along with whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The OA product allows users to exclude pixels that do not meet the quality criteria for their analysis. The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for analysing any change over time, since poor-quality pixels can significantly alter the percieved change over time. The most common use of OA is for cloud masking, where users can choose to remove images that have too much cloud, or ignore the clouds within each satellite image. A demonstration of how to use cloud masking can be found in the [masking data](../Frequently_used_code/Masking_data.ipynb) notebook.\n",
