    "\"Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.\" [[1](#References)] \n",

    "\"In the mid-1960s an ambitious effort to develop and launch the first civilian Earth observation satellite was started. The goal was achieved on July 23, 1972, with the launch of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1), which was later renamed Landsat 1. The launches of Landsat 2, Landsat 3, and Landsat 4 followed in 1975, 1978, and 1982, respectively. When Landsat 5 was launched in 1984, no one could have predicted that the satellite would continue to deliver high quality, global data of Earth's land surfaces for 28 years and 10 months until its retirement in June, 2013. Landsat 6, however, failed to achieve orbit in 1993. Landsat 7 was successfully launched in 1999 and, along with Landsat 8 launched in 2013, continues to provide daily global data. Landsat 9 is planned to be launched in late 2020.\" [[2](#References)]\n",

While this data has been used extensively for numerous land and coastal mapping studies, its utility for accurate monitoring of environmental resources has been limited by the processing methods that have been traditionally used to correct for inherent geometric and radiometric distortions in EO imagery. To improve access to Australia's archive of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data, GA has collaboratively developed an integrated approach to image data correction that incorporates normalising models to account for atmospheric effects, BRDF and topographic shading."

    "#### Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure: \"The Scan Line Corrector (SLC) is an electro-optical mechanism composed of two parallel mirrors set at an angle on a shaft. The SLC is positioned behind the primary optics and compensates for the along-track motion of the spacecraft occurring during an active SMA cross-track scan. As a result, a rectilinear scan pattern is produced using the SLC instead of the zigzag pattern that would be produced without it. The SLC failed for Landsat 7 on May 31, 2003. Without an operating SLC, the ETM+ line of sight now traces a zig-zag pattern along the satellite ground track (see the figure above) resulting in wedge shaped scan-to-scan gaps (and alternating overlap areas) which increase in magnitude away from nadir. Despite the SLC failure, Landsat 7 ETM+ is still capable of acquiring useful image data with the SLC turned off (SLC-off), particularly within the central portion of any given scene.\" [[8](#References)]\n",
