    "# Introduction to DEA Water Observations <img align=\"right\" src=\"../Supplementary_data/dea_logo.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "It is important to know where water is normally present in a landscape, where water is rarely observed, and where inundation has occasionally occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations tell us where flooding has occurred in the past, and allows us to understand wetlands, water connectivity and surface-groundwater relationships. This can lead to more effective emergency management and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the principal [Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Water Observations product](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/data-products/dea/613/dea-water-observations-landsat) (previously known as Water Observations from Space), providing the individual water observations per satellite image that are subsequently used in the following DEA Water Observations suite and related water bodies products. \n",
    "\n",
    "This product shows where surface water was observed by the Landsat satellites on any particular day since mid 1986. These daily data layers are termed Water Observations (WOs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this product offers\n",
    "DEA Water Observations provides surface water observations derived from Landsat satellite imagery for all of Australia from 1986 to present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WOs show the extent of water in a corresponding Landsat scene, along with the degree to which the scene was obscured by clouds, shadows or where sensor problems cause parts of a scene to not be observable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "The DEA Water Observations (WOs) are used to determine the area of surface water present in the corresponding satellite scene, and can be used for several water monitoring applications. Uses of the individual WOs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* flood extent\n",
    "* amount of water in water bodies, major rivers and the coastal zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the WOs are separated from the derived statistics of the associated DEA Water Observations statistical products, the WOs are most useful for performing analyses requiring the investigation of surface water extent for particular times rather than over long term time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publications\n",

    "WOs data are stored as a bit field. This is a binary number, where each digit of the number is independantly set based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular attribute (water, cloud, cloud shadow etc). In this way, a single decimal value for each pixel can provide information about a variety of features of that pixel. \n",
