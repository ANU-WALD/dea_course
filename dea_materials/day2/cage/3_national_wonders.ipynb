    "The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) is an 'optimized' vegetation index designed to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity in high biomass regions and improved vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmosphere influences. EVI is computed using three bands: Red, Blue and Near-Infrared but in this example we are going to use a simplified version which uses only 2 bands. The 2-Bands EVI or 2EVI, can be computed using the following formula:\n",

    "One of our most frequently used combinations of false colour images uses near infrared as red, red as green and green as blue. In this case, plants reflect near infrared and green light, while absorbing red. Since they reflect more near infrared than green, plant-covered land appears deep red. The signal from plants is so strong that red dominates the false-color view of plant dense areas. This band combination is often used to assess plant health.\n",
