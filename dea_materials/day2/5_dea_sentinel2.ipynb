    "#### Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the EU Copernicus Programme that systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (up to 10 m for some bands). The mission is based on a constellation of two identical satellites in the same orbit, 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Together, they cover all Earth's land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every 3-5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentinel-2A was launched on 23 June 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on 7 March 2017. Both of the Sentinel-2 satellites carry an innovative wide swath high-resolution multispectral imager with 13 spectral bands. For more information on the Sentinel-2 platforms and applications, check out the [European Space Agency website](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Digital Earth Australia (DEA) applies corrections to Sentinel-2 satellite images to arrive at a [surface reflectance](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/ga_s2_m_nbart_1) product (see the [introduction to Digtial Earth Australia](../Beginners_guide/02_DEA.ipynb) section for more information on the surface reflectance corrections). Surface reflectance provides standardised optical datasets by using robust physical models to correct for variations in image radiance values due to atmospheric properties, as well as sun and sensor geometry. The resulting stack of surface reflectance grids are consistent over space and time, which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DEA provides two Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentinel-2 Definitive** (e.g. `s2a_ard_granule`): These products represent the 'definitive' source of high quality Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data, and are available from the beginning of the Sentinel-2 archive up to a delay of several weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentinel-2 Near Real Time** (e.g. `s2a_nrt_granule`): These products are processed with best-available ancillary information and provided as a rolling 90 day archive of imagery which is typically available to load within approximately ~24 hours of a satellite overpass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Both Sentinel-2 Definitive and Sentinel-2 Near Real Time products contain data processed to two surface reflectance corrections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NBAR** (e.g. `nbar_green`): NBAR stands for Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance, where BRDF stands for Bidirectional reflectance distribution function.\n",
    "    The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute surface-leaving radiance and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NBAR-T** (e.g. `nbart_green`): Surface reflectance NBAR-T includes the terrain illumination reflectance correction and has the same features of NBAR, along with some additional features.\n"
